[P4]Modify the client and server so that the server “talks” first, sending a greeting message, and the client waits until it has received the greeting before sending anything. What needs to be agreed upon between client and server?


Below are the commands to run the program:

1) First we have to run on Server side.

Command on server side:
./TCPEchoServer 8888

2) Second we have to run on Client Side. 

Command on client side :
./TCPEchoClient "127.0.01" "I am Client" 8888
